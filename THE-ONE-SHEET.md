# Into The Darkness

This game uses ray-marching to create an "invisible maze." It requires the Player to navigate a collection of tunnels using only the "rays of light" that are cast around them. The rays appear to illuminate the walls of the Players surrounding. The objective of this game is to reach the exit which is identifed by the only other colored object on the screen.

## Summary of gameplay

As mentioned before the Player starts out in the world as an orb with white rays casting out of it. Here's how you play:

- Use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to navigate the level and solve the maze.
  - Be mindful of the walls which inhibit your progress on the level and require you to find a different path!
- Find the correct pathway and navigate to the other bright orb located somewhere within the level.

## Description of the three levels of gameplay

### Level 1

This level is very straight forward and educates the Player on how the game works. It simply requires the Player to travel from one end of the interface to the other. However, if the Player were to intersect with one of the barriers then it will restrict movement in that traveled direction.

### Level 2

Level 2 challenges the assumptions the Player made in the previous level and seeks to build upon the already acquired knowledge. Instead of presenting the Player with a challenging maze we instead give them a little bit of agency on thier choices. In this level there are two paths one could take: one ending in a dead-end and another path that contains the desired solution.

### Level 3

Level 3 is congruent to Level 2 in the sense that the Player is afforded more choice in their decisions of path-picking. Now there are multiple dead-ends that require the Player to retrace their path and instead choose a new method of attack. Now the stipulation is that there are many paths but only one that will provide the solution and the desired ending. The level is finished when the Player reaches the white orb contained in the upper center of the screen.
