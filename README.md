## Introduction
There are fourteen genres briefly discussed on pages 16‚Äì17 of our text. Choose one as the focus of your final project, avoiding augmented reality and party games. **Note**: The content of your project may not be racist, sexist, ablelist, transphobic, homophobic, misogynist, or offend any other category protected under applicable federal, state, or local law; and, it may not show or promote the abuse of animals.

## Instructions
### Levels
Your game requires three levels. The textbook discusses the different definitions of the term ‚Äúlevel‚Äù as it pertains to game design. Regardless of your game‚Äôs genre, level ‚Äî in the context of this project ‚Äî is synonymous with every definition discussed in the book. Revisit **Level 9, Everything I Learned About Level Design, I Learned from Level 9** for a clearer definition.

### Documentation
Your game requires a manual that instructs users on how to play your game. This is called a game design document, which is a multi-page manual and blueprint of your game. You‚Äôll be authoring a succinct version called ‚Äúthe one-sheet.‚Äù In your one-sheet, include **only** the following:

* Game title
* Target age of players
* Summary of game play
* Description of the three levels of game play

**Note**: The concepts in this section are discussed in more detail in **Level 4: You Can Design a Game, but Can You Do the Paperwork?**

Write all your one-sheet-related content in `THE-ONE-SHEET.md`, which is included in this repository. Ensure its Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is at least 9.

### Rules
* On game load, a UI asset should be displayed to the player that allows him/her/them to choose which level to play.
* Do not save scores; that is, do not save state.
* It should be clear to the player, via a UI asset, what level they‚Äôre on.
* A scoring mechanism must be implemented so as to indicate which entity is winning/losing.
* At the completion of every level, the player should be returned to the initial game load state.
* Your sketch‚Äôs code must be placed in `sketch/sketch.pde`.
* Any images you use must be placed in `sketch/img`. Keep each image under 1MB.
