# TODO
~~Get limited radius for rays on Schiffmans proj~~  
~~Rewrite his project variables to make more sense - `2-3 hours`~~  
~~Remove his walls and add my own simple walls – two vertical lines - `.5-1 hour`~~  
~~Detect collisions on these walls with the particle~~  
~~Make walls and start location to be loaded in via a file – this will allow me to make “Levels” easier - `3-4 hours`~~  
~~Add required “fluff” (UI, Level Select, Pause, instant gratification…) - `12-24 hours`~~  
 - ~~On game load, a UI asset should be displayed to the player that allows him/her/them to choose which level to play.~~
 - ~~It should be clear to the player, via a UI asset, what level they’re on.~~
 - ~~A scoring mechanism must be implemented so as to indicate which entity is winning/losing.~~
 - ~~At the completion of every level, the player should be returned to the initial game load state.~~
