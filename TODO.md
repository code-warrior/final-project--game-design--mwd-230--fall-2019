# TODO
~~Get limited radius for rays on Schiffmans proj~~  
Rewrite his project variables to make more sense - `2-3 hours`  
Remove his walls and add my own simple walls – two vertical lines - `.5-1 hour`  
~~Detect collisions on these walls with the particle~~  
Make walls and start location to be loaded in via a file – this will allow me to make “Levels” easier - `3-4 hours`  
Add required “fluff” (UI, Level Select, Pause, instant gratification…) - `12-24 hours`
